# Ryujinx.Graphics.RenderDocApi

This is a C# binding for RenderDoc's application API.
This is a source-inclusion of https://github.com/utkumaden/RenderdocSharp. 
I didn't use the NuGet package as I had a few minor changes I wanted to make, and I want to learn from it as well via hands-on experience.
